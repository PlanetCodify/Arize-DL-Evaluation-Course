##  This course by DeepLearning.AI and Arize AI took me through the entire lifecycle of building and evaluating LLM-powered agents.

The journey involved creating a Data Analysis Agent from scratch, equipped with capabilities to: 
üîç Generate and execute SQL queries for data retrieval 
üìä Perform in-depth data analysis 
üìà Create insightful visualizations

Through 5 hands-on labs, I learned crucial skills including:
- Agent decomposition and architecture
- Implementation of router and skill evaluations
- Trajectory analysis and structured evaluation frameworks
- Advanced LLM-as-a-judge techniques
- Agent monitoring and performance optimization

The playground interface is highly user-friendly while comparing experiments. Also, tracking and observing - spans and traces gave a whole new ability to evaluate each aspect of Agent lifecycle.
